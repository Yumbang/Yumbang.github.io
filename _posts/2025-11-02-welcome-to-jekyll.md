Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This post demonstrates various features of the blog theme.

## Features

This blog includes:

- **Clean, modern design** with a focus on readability
- **Responsive layout** that works on all devices
- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- **SEO optimization** with meta tags and structured data
- **Fast loading** with minimal CSS and no JavaScript frameworks

## Typography

The blog uses a serif font (Georgia) for body text to enhance readability, and a sans-serif system font stack for headings and UI elements.

### Code Examples

Here's an inline code example: `const greeting = "Hello, world!";`

And here's a code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55
```

Python example:

```python
def greet(name):
    """Return a friendly greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

## Lists

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

### Ordered List

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
